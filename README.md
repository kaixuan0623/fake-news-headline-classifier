By training a decision tree model on a large set of news headlines labeled as 'real' or 'fake', the program is able to make prediction on whether an input news is 'real' or 'fake' based on its headline (by looking at certain keywords appeared in the headline).

Can also calculate the information gain for a split based on the keyword that is used to do the split.
